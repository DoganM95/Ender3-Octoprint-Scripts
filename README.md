# Ender3-Octoprint

Custom g-code scripts, triggered by events like "on startup", "on print start", "on print pause", etc. in octoprint.  
Specific setup for this configuration/scripts:

- Cryogrip (Black, coarse texture, from Bigtreetech at Aliexpress), cut to fit the Ender 3
- [Bed led's](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4845956) (to visualize current printer state, explains `ENC` commands)
- Octoprint Enclosure plugin (provides custom commands, e.g. `ENC`)
- Filament runout sensor (for pause-resume functionality)
